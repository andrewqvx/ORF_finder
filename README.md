Open Reading Frame (ORF) Finder and Protein Translator
This project was developed as part of an introductory bioinformatics course during my undergraduate studies in biology. 
The script is a Bash-based pipeline designed to (when givena specific contig) process genomic data,
  identify Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and translate them into corresponding protein sequences. 
It demonstrates fundamental bioinformatics workflows, such as reverse complement generation, ORF detection, and protein sequence translation.
